### Description
A timestamp-entry is an [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) which provides chapter-like information about its content. When a youtube [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) is added its description and its comments are searched for possible timestamps. This is mostly the case with long videos which consist of several smaller videos.
### Trivia
Timestamp-Entry [Embed]({{ site.url }}/reference/embed)s -when using [`!np`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/np)- have the colour **<span style="color:#00FFFF">cyan</span>**
