### Command Structure
> `!np`

### Description
Use this command to find out what song is currently playing

### Result
When there's no [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) playing the result is an informal message telling you how to add an [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) to the queue. If there's something playing then the result depends on the [type of entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types) that's currently playing. The result can be an [embed]({{ site.url }}/reference/embed) with the information of a [complex-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/complex-entry), [radio-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) or a [timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry). The result could also be a plain text answer with the information of an [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) or a [stream-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/stream-entry)
