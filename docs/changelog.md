# What's new

- "Now Playing" Embeds have a different colour depending on their type:
  - Radio entries are magenta-ish
  - Complex entries are cyan
  - Timestamp entries are yellow
- Instead of only searching the description for possible timestamps, the comments are looked through too (for lack of trust it's a bit stricter)
- It is now possible to skip all sub-entries in a Timestamp-entry by using `!skip all`
