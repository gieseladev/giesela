# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- Due to a faulty RegEx code, my method for checking what the newest version is was broken. This has been fixed.
- Using [`!rwd`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/rwd) when there's a [complex-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/complex-entry) playing rewinds to the start of the previous song.
- Instead of returning the error that Giesela isn't in a voice channel, she now just joins one. (The voice channel choice is a three step maneuver. First she tries to join the channel with the most users in it, if that fails she tries to find the channel that *belongs* to her and if need be, she just chooses a random channel)
