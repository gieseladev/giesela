# What's new in `***REMOVED******REMOVED*** page.version ***REMOVED******REMOVED***`
- Fixed a config bug
- 9gag link-matching-RegEx now matches links with a html post
- New commands now come with some more origin info
- Added a [!history](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/history) command to log the last 10 entries
- Previously a user could still execute commands while in a "menu" (like the playlist builder), but because of a change in [version 3.3.0](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/changelogs/changelog-330) which allows users to discard the command prefix this system had to be changed so one can't use any other command until one leaves said *menu*.
- The [!getmusicfile](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/getmusicfile) command has been fixed.
- [!addplayingtoplaylist](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/addplayingtoplaylist) and [!removeplayingfromplaylist](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/removeplayingfromplaylist) work again
- [Timestamp-entries](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) now update their Discord Status when switching over timestamps.
