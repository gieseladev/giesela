# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- Implemented a way to show the current master version. This is the version Giesela has once she's been updated.
- Fixed an issue where the [`!queue`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) command wouldn't work anymore when there's a [timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) in it.
- Updated the playlists system to the new GPL system. In short this fixes the bug that playlist entries were being announced in the channel that they were originally created in. The new behaviour is that they're announced in the channel that the [`!playlist`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/playlist) was used in.
