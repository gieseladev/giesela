# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- Implemented a way to show the current master version. This is the version Giesela has once she's been updated.
- Fixed an issue where the [`!queue`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) command wouldn't work anymore when there's a [timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) in it.
