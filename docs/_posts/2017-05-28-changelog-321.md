# What's new in `***REMOVED******REMOVED*** page.version ***REMOVED******REMOVED***`

- Due to a faulty RegEx code, my method for checking what the newest version is was broken. This has been fixed.
- Using [`!rwd`](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/rwd) when there's a [complex-entry](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/complex-entry) playing rewinds to the start of the previous song.
- Instead of returning the error that Giesela isn't in a voice channel, she now just joins one. (The voice channel choice is a three step maneuver. First she tries to join the channel with the most users in it, if that fails she tries to find the channel that *belongs* to her and if need be, she just chooses a random channel)
- The `.gpl` (Giesela Playlist) format had a bug which wouldn't allow [timestamp-entries](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) to be properly saved.
- Re-styled the [`!queue`](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/queue) command to make it a bit more clear to which entry the displayed sub-entries belong
