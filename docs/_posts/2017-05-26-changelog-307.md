# What's new `3.0.7`

- "Now Playing" [Embed]({{ site.url }}/reference/embed)s have a different colour depending on their type:
  * [Radio entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) are magenta-ish
  * [Complex entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/complex-entry) are yellow
  * [Timestamp entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) are cyan
- Instead of only searching the description for possible timestamps, the comments are looked through too (for lack of trust it's a bit stricter)
- It is now possible to skip all sub-entries in a [Timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) by using [`!skip all`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/skip)
