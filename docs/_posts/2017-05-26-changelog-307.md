# What's new `3.0.7`

- "Now Playing" Embeds have a different colour depending on their type:
  * Radio entries are magenta-ish
  * Complex entries are cyan
  * [Timestamp entries]({{ site.url}}/reference/timestamp-entry) are yellow
- Instead of only searching the description for possible timestamps, the comments are looked through too (for lack of trust it's a bit stricter)
- It is now possible to skip all sub-entries in a [Timestamp-entry]({{ site.url}}/reference/timestamp-entry) by using `!skip all`
