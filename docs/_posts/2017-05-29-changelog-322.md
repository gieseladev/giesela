# What's new in `***REMOVED******REMOVED*** page.version ***REMOVED******REMOVED***`

- Spotify now requires an access token for search requests. With this version this has been implemented
- Added the `split-timestamp-entry` command inside the extras of the [`!playlist builder`](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/playlist) command.
