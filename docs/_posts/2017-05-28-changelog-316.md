# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- When an [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) was saved (for the playlist system) there was an error if the [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) couldn't be found on [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). This error has been resolved.
- Using [`!rwd`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/rwd) could previously rewind further than the song has actually been playing which led to the entry being skipped entirely. As of now, when trying to rewind too much, the song just restarts.
- Improved the visualisation of a playlist when using [`!playlist <playlist name>`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/playlist) by adding [embeds]({{ site.url }}/reference/embed).
- Removed the Auto-Gif-Embed feature for now because [Tenor](https://tenor.com) shows a false-positive.
- Implemented a way to block a command in order to prevent people from using it when something's broken

### Some Thoughts
A lot has happened in the past few updates concerning the behaviour -and especially the amount of information- of entries. Playlists that were created before [complex-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/complex-entry) and [timestamp-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) don't have those attributes saved within their `.gpl` (Giesela-Playlist) file. This doesn't pose too much of a problem because when an entry of such a playlist is next in queue, it searches for timestamps and/or information on [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). Still, this is something that bugs me because when using [`!queue`]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) this information isn't available.
