# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- [!bookmark]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/bookmark) command to bookmark a certain point in a song
- When there's a [timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) playing while using [!addplayingtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addplayingtoplaylist) or [!removeplayingfromplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/removeplayingfromplaylist), it adds the currently playing [timestamp-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) instead of the whole [entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry).
- When searching for timestamps, Giesela now accepts timestamps formatted like `<song name> <timestamp>` instead of the other way around. *Using the power of RegEx*
- **No matter the channel**, **a command will always be accepted** by Giesela. Inside of the "owned channels" a command **doesn't even require the prefix anymore**
- Removed redundant [!twitter]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/twitter) command. Discord have added their own implementation.
- Reworked the core config system so giesela can now change settings on the fly. This includes settings like the command prefix.
