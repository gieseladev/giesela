# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- (!bookmark)[{{ site.url }}/reference/commands/bookmark] command to bookmark a certain point in a song
- When there's a (timestamp-entry)[{{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry] playing while using (!addplayingtoplaylist)[{{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addplayingtoplaylist] or (!removeplayingfromplaylist)[{{ site.url }}/reference/commands/removeplayingfromplaylist], it adds the currently playing (timestamp-entry)[{{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry] instead of the whole (entry)[{{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry].
- When searching for timestamps, Giesela now accepts timestamps formatted like `<song name> <timestamp>` instead of the other way around. *Using the power of RegEx*
