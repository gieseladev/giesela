# What's new in `***REMOVED******REMOVED*** page.version ***REMOVED******REMOVED***`

- When an [entry](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/entry) was saved (for the playlist system) there was an error if the [entry](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/entry) couldn't be found on [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). This error has been resolved.
- Using [`!rwd`](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/rwd) could previously rewind further than the song has actually been playing which led to the entry being skipped entirely. As of now, when trying to rewind too much, the song just restarts.
