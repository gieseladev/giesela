# What's new in `***REMOVED******REMOVED*** page.version ***REMOVED******REMOVED***`

- Due to a faulty RegEx code, my method for checking what the newest version is was broken. This has been fixed.
- Using [`!rwd`](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/commands/rwd) when there's a [complex-entry](***REMOVED******REMOVED*** site.url ***REMOVED******REMOVED***/reference/entry_types/complex-entry) playing rewinds to the start of the previous song.
