# What's new `{{ page.version }}`

- The radio station [Radio 32](http://www.radio32.ch) now supports [radio-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry). Sadly the [radio-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) does not provide a duration or a progress indication.
- Removed the radio station [FragRadio](http://fragradio.com/) due to lack of interest.
