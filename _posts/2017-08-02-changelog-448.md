# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Optimised the GPL format.
- The [radio]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/radio) command works again.
- The Playlist Builder always sorts alphabetically.
- Switched to a different HTML parser. This should make the commands [lyrics]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/lyrics) and [version]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/version) as well as some [radio]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/radio)-station info crawlers work again.
- [execute]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/execute) command improvements
