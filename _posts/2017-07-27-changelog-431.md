# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Some simple bugs and missing import statements fixed
- [history]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/history) command shows the correct amount of entries being displayed. (No more "Showing 15 out of 6 entries")
- [play]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/play) command's "enqueued" message looks better now
- Entry version 1.0.3 introduces the final step needed to make caching working again.
