# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Made the [!help]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/help) command more useful by sorting commands into groups
- Making sure that when showing all the bookmarks that they're all on different lines
- When changing a playlist's name it no longer resets its replay count the playlist builder now shows all the entries when the amount of entries is a multiple of 20
- Fixed an issue with the [!replay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/replay) command
- The timestamp matching algorithm had a bug which stopped it from matching timestamps formatted like `<song name> <timestamp>`
- [!commandinfo]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/commandinfo) changelogs are never on the same line anymore
