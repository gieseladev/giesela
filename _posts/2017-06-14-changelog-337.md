# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Fixed a config bug
- 9gag link-matching-RegEx now matches links with a html post
- New commands now come with some more origin info
- Added a [!history]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/history) command to log the last 10 entries
- Previously a user could still execute commands while in a "menu" (like the playlist builder), but because of a change in [version 3.3.0]({{ site.url }}/changelogs/changelog-330) which allows users to discard the command prefix this system had to be changed so one can't use any other command until one leaves said *menu*.
- The [!getmusicfile]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/getmusicfile) command has been fixed.
- [!addplayingtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addplayingtoplaylist) and [!removeplayingfromplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/removeplayingfromplaylist) work again
- [Timestamp-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) now update their Discord Status when switching over timestamps.
- The command **[!skipto]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/seek)** is now called **[!seek]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/seek)** but works exactly the same way
