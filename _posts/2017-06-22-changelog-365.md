- Fixed some weirdly indented help texts
- Fixed [replay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/replay) command not using the right history index.
- [!addtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addtoplaylist) can now also add an entry to a playlist by its link or name and not just the current entry.
- The [ask]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/ask) command works again, yay.
- Show a list of all the changes when saving and closing a playlist.
- Don't just show the radio station's name but also the current song.
- The [default entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/entry) now also has an [embed]({{ site.url }}/reference/embed) with the video's name, its origin, a thumbnail and a link to the original video.
- [Timestamp-Entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/timestamp-entry) -when using [!np]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/np)- now also display a thumbnail.
- [removefromplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/removefromplaylist) can remove the current entry from the playlist it belongs to without having to specify the name of the playlist.
