# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- [autoplay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/autoplay) now uses Youtube recommendations to find the next video
- [radio]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/radio) plays the stations immediately.
- Fixed a typo in [addtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addtoplaylist)'s documentation.
- [spotify]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/spotify) command which currently doesn't do anything but load spotify playlists (in a very slow way).
