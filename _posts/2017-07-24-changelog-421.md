# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Fixed an issue with the editing process of a playlist's description
- Proud to announce that **Giesela** now uses [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) to store all kinds of images. The stored images can be found [here](http://giesela.imgur.com/).
- When having edited a playlist's entry, it now shows in the changelog.
- [commandinfo]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/commandinfo) displays the timestamp of an update in a better way.
- Adjusted the design of the playlist builder and the new entry manipulator
- Finally came around to standardise the use of **'** and **"**.
- [history]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/history) command now shows the amount of entries it displays.
- [editentry]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/editentry) command to edit the current entry outside of the playlist builder.
- Introducing a new type of entry. The [GieselaEntry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/giesela-entry) which acts like a [SpotifyEntry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/spotify-entry) but doesn't go into the same depth.
- Entries save their save location thus making caching possible again.
