# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Made the [!help]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/help) command more useful by sorting commands into groups
- Making sure that when showing all the bookmarks that they're all on different lines
- When changing a playlist's name it no longer resets its replay count the playlist builder now shows all the entries when the amount of entries is a multiple of 20
