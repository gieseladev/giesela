# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- Optimised some of the [lyrics]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/lyrics) background behaviour
- Improved some of the logging
- [Webiesela](http://giesela.org)'s remove from queue button works again
- fixed spelling error in [version]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/version) command
- "Queue" is now the term for what was referred to as "Playlist" before
- [reminder]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/reminder) command is gone
- Internal Interface system to make serialising stuff easier in the future
- [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) image links broke the cover generation, temporarily only using [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) covers.
- Implemented the [Connect Four]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/game) AI.
- Now using [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to track bugs.
- Introducing [Radio Bern1](http://www.radiobern1.ch/)
- Temporarily downgrading [Radio32](http://www.radio32.ch/) to a [RadioStationEntry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/RadioStationEntry) because they upgraded to a new system.
- Playlist system is going through a overhaul as we progress forward! Webiesela will also have a lot more on the frontend, including mobile optimization.
- Direct [spotify]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/spotify) URL playback is now supported, so any `open.spotify.com/track` links can be used directly with Giesela!
- Travis CI moving onwards (along with Sentry) for proper optimization
- More locale support with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)
- Lots of under-the-hood bug fixes, spelling fixes and optimizations
- Check out Trello for both [Giesela](https://trello.com/b/K5zhvvSY/giesela) and [Webiesela](https://trello.com/b/lUgFaaFH/webiesela)
