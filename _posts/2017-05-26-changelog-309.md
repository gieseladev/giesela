# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- The radio station [Radio 32](http://www.radio32.ch) now supports [radio-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry). Sadly the [radio-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) does not provide a duration or a progress indication.
- Removed the radio station [FragRadio](http://fragradio.com/) due to lack of interest.

# Known Bugs
- The [radio-entry]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) of the radio station [Energy Bern](https://energy.ch/play/bern) always displays information for the last song instead of the current one. This is due to a recent update where [NRJ](http://www.nrj.ch/) moved its servers to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) *(this is where [Giesela](https://siku2.github.io/Giesela/) is hosted btw.)* and reworked their [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) with modern security, namely [Amazon's Signature Signing Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html), in mind. At the moment there's no way to access their [playouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playout) other than with [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) - which is strongly discouraged by their imprint. The current solution is to use the old but still online [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) which only serves up to the last song.
