# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- When given mal-formatted arguments, the [playlist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/playlist) command would trap you "in a menu" so you couldn't use another command
  - Fixed the bug that caused it in the first place
  - Added a failsafe so this can't happen anymore
