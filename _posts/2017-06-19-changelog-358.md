# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Added [!version]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/version) command to display information about the development progress.
- Added [!interact]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/interact) command which allows testing of the new natural language update
- The [queue]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) command now only shows the first 15 entries unless specified otherwise (with the `quantity` argument)
- The [history]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/history) command looks more similar to the [queue]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) command now.
