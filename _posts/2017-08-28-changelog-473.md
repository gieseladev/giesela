# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- [autoplay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/autoplay) now uses Youtube recommendations to find the next video
- [radio]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/radio) plays the stations immediately.
- Fixed a typo in [addtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addtoplaylist)'s documentation.
- [spotify]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/spotify) command which currently doesn't do anything but load spotify playlists (very slowly). 
- The [radio]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/radio) station [Energy (Bern)](https://energy.ch/play/bern) now finally shows the current song instead of the last one (as mentioned in [Version 3.0.9]({{ site.url }}/changelogs/changelog-309)).
- [help]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/help) command list updated
- Giesela now automatically creates playlist covers for playlists that don't have one. She does this by choosing 4 random album covers from the playlist and combining them into one picture. If there are less than four covers in the playlist, no cover is created.
