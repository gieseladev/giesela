# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Fixed some weirdly indented help texts
- Fixed [replay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/replay) command not using the right history index.
- [!addtoplaylist]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/addtoplaylist) can now also add an entry to a playlist by its link or name and not just the current entry.
- The [ask]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/ask) command works again, yay.
- Show a list of all the changes when saving and closing a playlist.
