# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Fixed a bug in the [!history]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/history) command.
- Edit function for [bookmarks]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/bookmark) so you can rename and adjust your precious moments
- Added the [!commandinfo]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/commandinfo) command which shows a command's history
- [!bookmark]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/bookmark) list filter to only show one's bookmarks
- [!replay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/replay) command now replays the last song instead of the current one when either the "last" keyword is given or there's nothing playing.
- [!rwd]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/rwd) can now rewind past the current song.
