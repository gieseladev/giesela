- Playlist system is going through a overhaul as we progress forward! Webiesela will also have a lot more on the frontend, including mobile optimization.
- Direct [spotify]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/spotify URL playback is now supported, so any `open.spotify.com/track` links can be used directly with Giesela!
- Travis CI moving onwards (along with Sentry from 4.9.6) for proper optimization
- More locale support with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)
- Lots of under-the-hood bug fixes, spelling fixes and optimizations
