# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`

- **Many** important updates/fixes in `4.9.6` [(changelog here)](https://siku2.github.io/Giesela/changelogs/changelog-496) that are relevant to the overall update - this was just posted one day before `4.9.7` (current changelog) 
- Playlist system is going through a overhaul as we progress forward! Webiesela will also have a lot more on the frontend, including mobile optimization.
- Direct [spotify]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/spotify) URL playback is now supported, so any `open.spotify.com/track` links can be used directly with Giesela!
- Travis CI moving onwards (along with Sentry from `4.9.6`) for proper optimization
- More locale support with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)
- Lots of under-the-hood bug fixes, spelling fixes and optimizations
- Check out Trello for both [Giesela](https://trello.com/b/K5zhvvSY/giesela) and [Webiesela](https://trello.com/b/lUgFaaFH/webiesela)
