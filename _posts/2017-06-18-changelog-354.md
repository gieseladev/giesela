# What's new in `{{ page.version }}`
- Extended timestamp matcher to recognise even more timestamps
- Updated the [!queue]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/queue) command's design
- Updated help text for several commands
- [!replay]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/replay) command can now replay past entries by index
- **Code Cleanup**! yep, it's that time of the year again:
  - Removed permissions because be honest, who needed that crap anyway
  - Autopausing doesn't require an override anymore (whatever that means, amirite?)
  - Improved logging
- Improved the looks of the [!np]({{ site.url }}/reference/commands/np) command
- [Radio-entries]({{ site.url }}/reference/entry_types/radio-entry) now update their now playing status according to what's currently playing (not yet available for all radio stations)
