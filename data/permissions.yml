  # global roles apply in dm and across guilds. Global roles CANNOT be used in a guild (you can't assign them to a role or member).
  # Non-global roles defined in this file are still globally available (I know, it's confusing. Don't blame me) which means that any guild can assign
  # them to its roles/members but they won't be able to edit them (Only global roles with permissions.roles.edit will be able to edit them).
  # Non-global roles in this file can be seen as the default roles for a given guild, only that they cannot be removed for a specific guild.
  # Keep in mind that of course guild-specific roles will be prioritised over these non-global roles which makes it possible "overwrite" them!

  # "queue.add" which will grant all the permissions in said group (in this case: "queue.add.entry", "queue.add.playlist", "queue.add.stream")
  #     Note: You can also use "deny" to explicitly deny a permission. !!deny takes precedence over grant!!
